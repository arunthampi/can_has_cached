= can_has_cached

== Synopsis

Like cache_fu, but uses the faster and more awesome memcached gem by Evan Weaver (http://blog.evanweaver.com/files/doc/fauna/memcached/files/README.html) and with an emphasis on as little magic as possible. Oh and there's no ActiveRecord integration too. I guess it's not really like cache_fu.

== Dependencies

* memcached Rubygem - see http://blog.evanweaver.com/files/doc/fauna/memcached/files/README.html
* libmemcached -http://tangent.org/552/libmemcached.html
* RSpec (optional, required for running specs)
